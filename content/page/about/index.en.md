## About Me

I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology. My previous research focus was on high-performance computing, and now I am focusing on deep generative models, occasionally paying attention to AI Infra work. Recently, I have been learning and exploring the field of diffusion models, hoping to publish a good paper in the future. At the same time, I am also considering whether to pursue a Ph.D. or enter the workforce in the future. Although it's not yet time to make a decision, I should think about it in advance to have better options. I also welcome fellow students who are similarly undecided to discuss this with me.

I don't have any sophisticated hobbies. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, music, and games. Traveling to unfamiliar places can bring a lot of freshness, and I hope to visit every province in China before my student days end, and also travel around the world as much as possible. In terms of music, I mainly listen to Japanese music (but not JPOP), and I have been a fan of Yuki Kajiura (Fiction Junction) and Kokia for many years. [This album](http://gallery.kambri.top/live/) records the LIVE shows I've attended. Living is all about sustainably attending more LIVE shows. As for games, I used to play a lot, but recently I haven't had much time due to my studies. I have tried many types of games in the past, and I want to list some of my favorites (I've wanted to do this for a long time), such as the Type-Moon series (FGO/Mahoutsukai no Yoru/Tsukihime), the Final Fantasy series (VII/XIV/XV), the Pokémon series (Sword and Shield/Scarlet and Violet/Arceus/ZA), etc. I've also played quite a few FPS and MOBA games, but I'm not very good at them.

## About the Site

This site is built with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) and uses the [Stack theme](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack) (`v3.33.0`) with modifications. It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and uses Alibaba Cloud CDN for domain distribution. The comment system is supported by [Utterances](https://github.com/utterance).

The site was officially established on `2024/11/23` and underwent a "remake" at the beginning of 2026. The posts and comments from the old blog have been archived [here](https://github.com/KaigeZheng/Personal-Blog-Archive). I will write and upload (or update previous posts) whenever I have time, and I will also update the blog style based on some needs during my continuous exploration (but I won't spend too much effort on it, as front-end development is not my main focus).
