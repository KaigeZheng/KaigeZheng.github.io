## Welcome——

Welcome to my life & technology blog! A solitary life also needs some sense of outward expression. I wanted to satisfy some "sharing desire" in a place that doesn't restrict content and form, so I established this site at the end of 2024 and have been exploring and improving it ever since. Initially, I used Hugo and the Stack theme template to quickly build a blog and wrote some life records and technology shares. Later, I found that most of my technology shares were inefficient (neither spreading some novel thoughts nor fully serving the purpose of knowledge accumulation). At the beginning of 2026, I rebuilt the blog based on the [v3.33.0](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/releases/tag/v3.33.0) branch of Stack and made some modifications with my limited front-end skills according to my ideas. This time, I plan to focus on life archiving (such as recording travel experiences, sharing annual summaries, etc.) and occasionally write some reflections on research. Due to limited energy, I may not write or update very frequently, and of course, the text and form will be more casual. Additionally, I have set up a [personal photo gallery](https://gallery.kambri.top/), hoping to archive some meaningful photos, temporarily named **Cached Memory**.

There probably won't be many people seeing this blog; I will only share it with a certain range of friends. Of course, it supports Bing and Google searches, so the main purpose of writing the blog is to record life and entertain myself. Anyway, no matter how you accessed here, I feel honored. **Your arrival is also part of the meaning of establishing this blog.**
