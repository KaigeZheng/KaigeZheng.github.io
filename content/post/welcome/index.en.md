## Welcome——

Welcome to my life & tech blog! A solitary life also needs to maintain a sense of outward expression. I wanted to satisfy some "desire to share" in a place not constrained by content and form, so I established this site at the end of 2024 and have been exploring and improving it since. Initially, I quickly built a blog using Hugo and the Stack theme template, writing some life records and tech shares. Later, I realized that most of my tech shares were not efficient (neither spreading some novel thoughts nor fully serving as a knowledge repository for me). At the beginning of 2026, I rebuilt the blog based on the [v3.33.0](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/releases/tag/v3.33.0) branch of Stack and made some modifications with my limited front-end skills according to my ideas. This time, I plan to focus on life archiving (such as recording travel experiences, sharing annual summaries, etc.) and occasionally write some reflections on research. Due to limited energy, I may not write or update very frequently, and of course, the text and form will be more casual. Additionally, I have set up a [personal photo album](https://gallery.kambri.top/), hoping to archive some meaningful photos, temporarily named **Cached Memory**.

Probably not many people will see this blog; I will only share it within a certain range of friends, though it also supports Bing and Google searches. So, the main purpose of writing the blog is to record life and entertain myself. Anyway, no matter how you accessed here, I feel honored. **Your arrival is also part of the reason I created this blog.**
